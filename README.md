# Language Server Proxy Tools

This library is a set of convenient and partly customizable tools for working with my [Language Server Proxy](https://github.com/MozarellaMan/rust-lsp-proxy) program.
The goal of this library is to enable you to have an easy to use interface with the proxy, with useful defaults, while also providing room for flexibility and tailoring to your project's needs.
